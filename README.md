# Simple Block Driver

Simple example of block driver. It consist from one **block device driver** with RAM buffer and two user mode applications. **Writer** communicate with driver and translate data to file shared memory. **Viewer** read file shared memory and print it to console. Tested on *Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS* \
In Template dir you can find settigns for vscode c_cpp plugin. Change paths for you current one. Installed linux header in prepare part need to be compiled.

## Prepare
```console
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install linux-headers-$(uname â€“r)
sudo apt install gcc
sudo apt install make
```
## Make Cmd
From Drv directory you can compile kernel headers and driver. You can also install and uninstall it.
```console
make all
make install
make uninstall
make clean
```
In User directory you can compile two user mode application.

## Tools
Show debug messages:
```console
sudo dmesg
```
Show information about kernel module:
```console
sudo lsmod
cat /proc/devices
ls /dev
sudo fdisk -l
cat /proc/partition
blockdev --getsize64 /dev/DRiVeerDNA0
```

Show kernel version
```
lsb_release -a
```
